## Create Your New Server

To begin with, you need to decide on the server's template and purpose, then customize it according to your purpose and
preferences. Here’s how you’ll set everything up:

1. Select a pre-defined Discord template or create a custom server.

     Discord provides templates for various needs such as Gaming, School Club, or Study Group.
