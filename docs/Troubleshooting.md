| **Symptoms**                          | **Probable Cause**                                                           | **Solution**                                                                                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Unable to Add Channels**            | Lack of permissions to create channels.                                      | Ensure you have the necessary permissions. Server owners should check role settings. Refreshing the page might help.                                                                      |
| **Invite Links Not Working**          | Restrictions in server settings or incorrectly formatted custom links.       | Create a new invite link and verify server settings for any restrictions. Ensure custom links are correctly formatted.                                                                    |
| **Unable to Start an Activity**       | Insufficient permissions to initiate activities within the server.           | Verify you have the appropriate permissions. Adjustments can be made by server owners or admins. Consider changing the server's region if problems persist.                               |
| **Can't See or Join the Activity**    | Not in the same voice channel or activity has reached its participant limit. | Join the voice channel where the activity was initiated. Check if the activityâ€™s participant limit has been reached.                                                                      |
| **Unable to Upload Emoji or Sticker** | Incorrect file size or format, or lacking necessary permissions.             | Ensure emojis are under 256KB and in PNG, JPG, or GIF format; stickers should be in PNG format and under 500KB. Check that "Manage Emojis" and "Manage Stickers" permissions are enabled. |
