# Troubleshoot

## Add Friends To Your Server

### Unable to Add Channels

Solution:

• Make sure you have permissions to create channels. If you're the server owner, check your role
settings. Try refreshing the page if the problem persists.

### Invite Links Not Working

Solution:

• Create a new invite link and double-check the server settings for any invite restrictions. If using a custom link,
make sure it's formatted correctly.

## Start activities with Friends

### Unable to Start an Activity

Solution:

• Check if you have the right permissions within the server to start activities. Server owners or admins can adjust
these settings.

• Sometimes, changing the server's region can fix the problem.

### Can't See or Join the Activity

Solution:

• Make sure you're in the same voice channel where the activity started.

• Check if the activity has a participant limit. Ensure it hasn't been reached.

## Make Customized Stickers and Emojis

### Unable to Upload Emoji or Sticker

Solution:

• Check the file size and format. Emojis should be under 256KB and in PNG, JPG, or GIF format. Stickers should be in PNG
format and under 500KB.

• Make sure the "Manage Emojis" and "Manage Stickers" permissions are turned on for the roles that need them.
