Ensure you have the necessary permissions. Server owners should check role settings. Refreshing the page might help. Invite Links Not Working Restrictions in server settings or incorrectly formatted custom links. Create a new invite link and verify server settings for any restrictions. Ensure custom links are correctly formatted. Unable to Start an Activity Insufficient permissions to initiate activities within the server. Verify you have the appropriate permissions. Adjustments can be made by server owners or admins. Consider changing the server's region if problems persist. Unable to See or Join the Activity Not in the same voice channel or activity has reached its participant limit. Join the voice channel where the activity was initiated. Check if the activity\u2019s participant limit has been reached. Unable to Upload Emoji or Sticker Incorrect file size or format, or lacking necessary permissions. Ensure emojis are under 256KB and in PNG, JPG, or GIF format; stickers should be in PNG format and under 500KB.
